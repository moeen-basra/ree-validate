### Issues

When creating issues, please provide as much details as possible. A clear explanation on the issue and a reliable production example can help us greatly in improving this project. Your issue may get closed if it cannot be easily reproduced so please provide a working example using either [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). Your example should only focus on the issue, minimal and clearly produces the issue.

If your issue gets closed for not providing enough info or not responding to the maintainers' comments, do not consider it a hostile action. There are probably other issues that the maintainers are working on and must give priority to issues that are well investigated, you can always revisit the issue and address the reasons that it was closed and we will be happy to re-open it and address it properly. Sometimes a commit will close your issue without a response from the maintainers so make sure you read the issue timeline to prevent any misunderstandings.

### Code Style

The code style is enforced with `eslint` and is checked automatically whenever you commit. Any violation of the code style may prevent merging your contribution so make sure you follow it. And yes we love our semi-colons.

### Commit Style

Commit messages are enforced with `commitlint` which is configured to help you write a suitable commit message, the checks are run automatically when you commit.

### Contributing To The Docs

If you want to contribute to the docs you can find it in the `docs` folder.

Our docs require `./dist/ree-validate.esm` as dependency to run successfully in your local machine. You can generate this dependency by executing the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
yarn build
# or
npm run build
```

And then you can run vuepress local dev server by running:

```bash
yarn docs:dev
# or
npm run docs:dev
```
